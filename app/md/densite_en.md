This page presents **the densities evolution of a cohort during successive samplings for three scenarios** (low, medium and high recruitment). Results provide and idea of the carrying capacity of a river reach, particularly in case of a good recruitment, or restocking. Densities are expressed as the number of individuals per 100 m^2 of watercourse.

The figure in **the tab 0+** presents the hypotheses for the three scenarios: the observed 0+ density ranges during the September electric sample (year n).

Depending on the indicated environmental conditions in the box on the left, the model predicts:
- in **the 1+ tab**: the predicted 1+ density range in September the year (n + 1).
- in **the tab >1+**: the predicted >1+ density range in September the year (n + 2).
