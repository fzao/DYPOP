This page proposes to follow **the evolution of the densities of a cohort during successive samplings in three scenarios** (low, medium and high recruitment). This makes it possible to apprehend the capacity of a section to keep a large population within it, in the event of good recruitment, or restocking for example. Densities are expressed as the number of individuals per 100 m^2 of watercourse.

The figure in **the tab 0 +** presents the hypotheses proposed behind the three scenarios: the ranges of densities of 0+ observed during the September electric fisheries (year n).

Depending on the environmental conditions entered in the insert on the left, the model predicts:
- in **the 1 + tab**: the range of densities of 1+ predicted by the model in September the year (n + 1).
- in **the tab> 1 +**: the range of densities of> 1+ predicted by the model in September the year (n + 2).
