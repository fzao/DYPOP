This page enables prediction of **annual apparent survival** (between two samples) of the young of the year (tab 0+), 1-year-old trout (tab 1+) and adult trout (tab â‰¥ 1 +).

The estimate is calculated from the physical parameters of the station (input data in the box on the left). It is shown as a curve plotted according to density (number of individuals per 100 m<sup>2</sup>) of the development stage in question (x-axis).
