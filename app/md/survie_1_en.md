This page proposes to predict the **annual apparent survival rate** (between two samples) of the young of the year (tab 0+), 1-year-old trout (tab 1+) and adult trout (tab> 1 +).

This estimate is calculated from the physical parameters of the station (entries in the box on the left). It is represented in the form of a curve plotted as a function of the densities (number of individuals / 100 m<sup>2</sup>) of the age group considered (x-axis).
