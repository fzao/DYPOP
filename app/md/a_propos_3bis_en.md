<font size="4">The samplings were carried out by **electric fishing by feet with several successive passages** (according to standard XP T90-383). The **trout densities were estimated by the method of Carle & Strub** (1978). They are **expressed in number of individuals per 100 m^2** of watercourse. Three age groups were distinguished from the size frequency histograms: **young born in the year (0+), 1-year-old trout (1+) and adult trout (> 1 +)**. The **distribution of the 428 densities observed for each age group** covers a wide range.</font>
