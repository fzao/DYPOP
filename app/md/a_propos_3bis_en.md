<font size="4">Reaches were sampled by wading, using two-pass removal electrofishing sampling, meeting European Committee for Standardization guidelines (CEN, 2003). The observed **trout densities were estimated with the Carle & Strub** (1978) method. They are **expressed in number of individuals per 100 m^2** of watercourse. Length-frequency histograms distinguished three development stages: 0+ (young-of-the-year), 1+ (between 1 and 2 years old), and adult (all fish older than 2 years). The **distribution of the 428 observed densities for each development stage** covers a wide range.</font>
