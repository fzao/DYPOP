<font size="4">**DYPOP is a web app to assess the survival and the densities expected from trout (_Salmo trutta_) populations according to the parameters of the environment. It is based on the results of a population dynamics model for trout.**</font>

### **Operating principle**


<font size="4">A **high variability in densities** of trout is observed depending on the year of inventory, the type of environment and the different stages of development (fry, juvenile, adult). This makes it difficult to diagnose the state of a population. Also, a population dynamics model has been developed to explain this variability in densities between sites.</font>


<font size="4">The life cycle of trout has been modeled by representing the processes linking the different stages of development.</font>


<font size="4">The **hierarchical model** made it possible to estimate the common processes of population dynamics (at the scale of France), but also to identify the origin of the variations observed at the level of each watercourse studied.</font>


<font size="4">In addition, the **Bayesian** framework in which the model was developed made it possible to take explicit account of uncertainty (linked to sampling, estimated parameters, predictions).</font>
