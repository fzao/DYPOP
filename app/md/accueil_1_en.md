<font size="4">**DYPOP is a web app to estimate the expected survival and densities of a trout (_Salmo trutta_) populations according to environmental drivers. It is based on the results of a trout population dynamics model.**</font>

### **Operating principle**


<font size="4">A **high variability in trout densities** is generally observed among sampling years depending on the physical context and the development stage (fry, juvenile, adult). This makes difficult to estimate a population status. Then, a population dynamics model was built to explain this density variability by assessing the relative influence of local and global drivers of mortality in brown trout populations.</font>


<font size="4">The life cycle of trout has been modeled by representing the processes linking the different stages of development.</font>

<font size="4">The model is based on a complete representation of the brown trout life cycle, in which demographic processes operate on the different development stages.</font>

<font size="4">The **hierarchical model** provided an estimation of the common processes of population dynamics (in France), and identified the drivers  of the variability at the level of each studied reach.</font>


<font size="4">In addition, the Bayesian framework of the model can account for multiple source of uncertainty (linked to sampling, estimated parameters, predictions).</font>
