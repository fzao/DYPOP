The results of the Bayesian model give a median prediction and the uncertainty envelope around this prediction:

- The red line corresponds to the median prediction.
- 50% of the survival rates predicted by the model are contained in the dark gray envelope.
- 95% of the survival rates predicted by the model are contained in the light gray envelope.

The annual apparent survival values can be greater than 100%, since they incorporate possible departures/arrivals in the river reach, especially when density is initially very low.
