### **How to use DYPOP ?**

<font size="4">DYPOP **assesses the expected densities and mortalities** on a river reach according to the thermal regime and to the quantity of shelters. The comparison between the predicted values and the observed values provides an estimation of the population status.</font>

<font size="4">The population effect of an **increase of shelters** can be simulated as well as the effect of a **temperature increase** or **re-stocking**.</font>
