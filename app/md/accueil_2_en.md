### **How to use DYPOP ?**

<font size="4">DYPOP allows **to assess the densities and mortalities** expected on a stretch of river according to the thermal regime and the quantity of shelters. The comparison between the predicted values and the observed values makes it possible to estimate the state of the population.</font>

<font size="4">The population effect of **the increase in shelter** can be simulated as well as the effect of **temperature increase** or **re-stocking**.</font>
