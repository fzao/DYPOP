### **Details on the dataset used to build the model**

<font size="4">The development of the trout population dynamics model, the results of which we share here, was based on **428 fish samplings, carried out on 40 sections of French watercourses** including 19 in a short-circuited section downstream a hydroelectric dam. The details of these samplings are given below.</font>

<font size="4">The 40 study stretches were sampled 4 to 20 times between 1990 and 2013, in summer or early fall (the median date for sampling is September 10). The **geographic distribution** of these sections is presented opposite.</font>
